#AVAS (Audio Video Archiving System)

This project contains a set of applications to allow you to queue up, process, and then archive online videos using youtube-dl. I've created it as a personal project, but feel free to use it, extend it, share it, etc. My implementation has an azure web app along w/ a windows service to process the files, but you can do it all locally if you'd like.

AVAS is mainly used for archiving online videos that are supported by youtube-dl for downloading (which is the majority of videos online if you can get the source URL).
